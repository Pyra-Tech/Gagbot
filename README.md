# Gagbot
A bot for NSFW roleplay involving chat control on users! This is still under active development! The bot is written using Node.js and leverages the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library. See [Setup](https://github.com/Enraa/Gagbot/blob/main/SETUP.md) for setting this project up.

### What is it?
This bot is designed to facilitate roleplay scenarios involving certain toys within a channel. This is intended for use only with consenting adults and should not be considered or tolerated in environments with users below that age. The effects are also strictly limited to moderately tasteful text and holds no NSFW graphics. This bot's focus is on facilitating the environments in which others can engage in that, if they so choose. 

### Consent
It is designed with a **Consent First** approach, where while most actions can be done to a given user, it is trivial to revert them using the appropriate un___ command. In order to prevent this, users have to willingly use certain commands which are called out in their description. 

### Contributions
Please feel free to suggest or submit contributions for this code. Please keep in mind while considering using this or forking it that I would like to maintain the philosophy this bot was built upon: facilitating consenting roleplay. Features that infringe upon that or are obscene will be rejected outright.
